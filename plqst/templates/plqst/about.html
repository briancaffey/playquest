<h2>About PlayQuest</h2>

<p>PlayQuest is a platform for creating fun, simple and interactive games and stories with emoji ‚Äî right in your browser!</p>
<p>In just minutes, you can create a simple, interactive and fun PlayQuest game. Choose from over 1,000 emoji to build your scenes, characters, special items, or whatever you can think of! Then play and share your game instantly on any device!</p>

<h3>Who is PlayQuest for?</h3>
<p>PlayQuest was originally designed as tool to give kids hands-on experiencing making simple games. PlayQuest aims to introduce abstract concepts and logical thinking in a digital, online, and social environment. We don't have an official recommended age range, but we are working hard to get kids excited about the more technical aspects of games as early as possible. We also think that PlayQuest games can be enjoyed by a much larger age range ‚Äî who doesn't love playing with emoji? ü§∑üèª‚Äç</p>

<h3>Cool, how can I get involved?</h3>
<p>We're glad you asked! PlayQuest is currently in a public alpha testing phase. This means that it is still being developed and optimized. If you are a parent, we invite you to explore the tools we have for creating games. Simply go to <a href="http://www.playquest.io/create">playquest.io/create</a> and have a look around.
