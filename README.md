## Playquest

Playquest started as a simple exercise to learn a little bit more about Javascript and frontend development, and it has grown into a full web app that allows you to create and share interactive RPG games.

You can find the live site at [playquest.io](http://playquest.io)

Here are the technologies I used to put this project together:

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for overall structure, authentication, views and templates
- [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for serializing game data to JSON
- Postgresql for storing game data in JSON format
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for rendering
- AJAX for saving and loading game data
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for UI
- [vocalware](https://www.vocalware.com) API for in-game text narration
- [hammer.js](https://hammerjs.github.io/) for gesture detection on mobile
- [hash_ids](http://hashids.org/) for creating unique URLs
